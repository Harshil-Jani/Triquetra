     <h2><u> Basic Communication Lab</u></h2>
     <h4> This laboratory is dedicated for learning the practical aspects of subject related to Communication Engineering. Earlier the laboratory of subjects like RF & Microwave Communication, Optical Communication were also conducted along with Analog & Digital Communication. Since 2016, the laboratory was renamed to Basic Communication Lab and has been more focused for core Communication Engineering subjects.
The communication Systems Laboratory intends to cover the basic understanding of functionalities of various block-sets involved in communication system. It involves system design and simulation exercises using software like MATLAB/Sci Lab, Simulink and experiments based on HW boards. Students are introduced to the functioning of modern communication systems and their performance in the presence of noise.
